1. cpputest should be downloaded, locally or else it should be cloned,from offical repo and the cloned folder should be include in the root of the project folder. 
2. then prepare the cmakelist, where you have to give all the required paths where the test cases and the source code are have been presented,
3. after comp[letion all the process if want to check the coverage report the in the cmakelist you have to add some lines as 


# Enable code coverage in Debug mode
option(COVERAGE "Enable running with coverage" ON)

if(COVERAGE)
    message(STATUS "Enabling code coverage flags")
    set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} --coverage -g -O0")
    set(CMAKE_C_FLAGS "${CMAKE_C_FLAGS} --coverage -g -O0")
    set(CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS "${CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS} --coverage")
endif()


then create the executable by running the commands as 

cmake ..     (..) if you are inside the build folder

make

after that ./you executable file name

to check then coverage mmannualy give coomand as:
                                                  lcov --capture --directory . --output-file coverage.info
						genhtml coverage.info --output-directory coverage_report
						 xdg-open coverage_report/index.html


before that you shouuld install the lcov  : 

 sudo apt update
sudo apt install lcov
lcov --version
